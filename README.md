# Quantitative-Finance: Portfolio Optimization 

## Introduction
This is a Jupyter Notebook project that demonstrates portfolio optimization using the mean-variance method and Monte Carlo simulation. The purpose of this project is to show how these two methods can be used to create efficient portfolios that maximize expected return while minimizing risk.

## Portfolio Optimization with Mean-Variance Method
We will use the mean-variance method to optimize our portfolio. We will first calculate the expected return and variance of each asset, and then use these values to find the optimal combination of assets that minimizes the portfolio variance for a given expected return. We will also plot the efficient frontier to visualize the optimal portfolios.

## Monte Carlo Simulation for Portfolio Optimization
In this section, we will use Monte Carlo simulation to generate a large number of hypothetical portfolios and identify the optimal portfolio based on certain criteria (such as the highest expected return for a given level of risk). We will also plot the results of the simulation to visualize the optimal portfolios.
